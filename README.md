## Inspiration

We were inspired by the shortcomings of Canvas's messaging system and decided to improve it by incorporating elements of our favorite messaging apps, Slack and Discord.

## What it does

Allows users to communicate with other students in their classes.

## How we built it

We build our website using NodeJS and React. We used Firebase Firestore Cloud for storing message data.

## Challenges we ran into

Everything

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Being able to make a functioning messaging app was cool. We implemented most of the UI from scratch.

## What we learned

We all have picked up some web development skills in using NodeJS, React, and Javascript in general. 

## What's next for EduCord

We will implement file sharing and class roles.
